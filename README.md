# Automatic-Hen-House
my arduino projects

With the help of one Arduino Uno + one DS3231 + 2 water pump, I will open or close the door of my Hen House at Sunrise and sunset.

I know my GPS position and the hours - > I will calculate the sunrise and sunset.
Moreover my arduino will often sleep for reducing the need of power.
